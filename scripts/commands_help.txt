Commands used to setup the local PostgreSQL database:

    - Check if the command Postgres command works:
        psql --version
    - Create database (only executed 1 time):
        psql -U postgres
        CREATE DATABASE practice_datasets;
        ALTER DATABASE practice_datasets SET client_encoding TO 'UTF8';
        \q
    - Schema creation (can be executed several times):
        psql -U postgres -f schema_creation_psql.sql
    - The next commands can be used to check the results 
    (use "psql -U postgres" to enter the Postgres console):
        - List all databases:
            \l
        - Connect to the database:
            \c practice_datasets
        - Show all schemas in database:
            \dn
        - Show all tables in schema:
            SELECT * from pg_tables where schemaname='imdb_dwh';
        - Terminate active connections:
            SELECT pg_terminate_backend(pg_stat_activity.pid) FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE pg_stat_activity.datname = 'practice_datasets' AND pid <> pg_backend_pid();
        - Drop database
            DROP DATABASE practice_datasets WITH (FORCE);

    NOTE: To use the psql command in Windows, it is necessary to add the next path to the 
    Environmental Variable PATH, and executing it as Admin:
        <Installation folder>\PostgreSQL\<version>\bin\

Commands used to launch a Docker with Streamlit:
    NOTE: Admin privileges needed (best option is execute them from Docker Desktop)

    Build the Docker image (replace the next path with the one where you have stored the project)
        docker build -t streamlit-imdb-dashboard "C:\Users\dfernasu\OneDrive - NTT DATA EMEAL\Documentos\GitHub\streamlit-imdb-dashboard"

    Run the Docker container
        docker run -it --rm -p 8501:8501 --name streamlit-imdb-dashboard-container streamlit-imdb-dashboard
